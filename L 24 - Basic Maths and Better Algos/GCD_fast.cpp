//     Euclidean algorithm for GCD of two numbers:
// The idea of this algorithm is, the GCD of two numbers doesnâ€™t change if the smaller number is subtracted from the bigger number. This is the Euclidean algorithm by subtraction. It is a process of repeat subtraction, carrying the result forward each time until the result is equal to any one number being subtracted.
